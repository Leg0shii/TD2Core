# TD2Core

TD2Core is a Minecraft plugin I built for a massive parkour map. It’s designed to make the parkour experience way more interactive and competitive.

### Map & Section Selection 
You can pick specific sections or complete maps to tackle. It shows your progress, leaderboards, and overall stats right there in-game.

### Discord Integration
As you progress, a Discord bot updates your role in the server, so everyone knows how you’re doing. It also tracks everyone’s progress on the server. Join [here](https://discord.gg/W3EUnbG6gp).

### Stat Tracking
Every jump, every fail, and your time are tracked. You can see how you stack up against others on a global leaderboard.

### Further Features
- **Cool Pressure Plates**: There are custom pressure plates that can be timed, teleport you, or give potion effects. Some are linked, so only specific ones activate in sequence.

- **Inventory Customization**: You can configure your inventory however you like. Everything is super modular, so it can fit any parkour style or map.

- **Replay Anticheat**: If suspicious behabviour is noticed, the self-made anticheat records the players movement and lets staff review the behaviour.

- **Highly Modular:** Built to be flexible and adaptable, TD2Core can be customized to fit different parkour maps and play styles!
